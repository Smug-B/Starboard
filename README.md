# Starboard


This a light-weight imitation of [CircuitSacul's Starboard-4](https://github.com/CircuitSacul/Starboard-4) albeit written with in Python 3.12 with a few changes. The most notable of which being automatic starboard support for any emote, with comprehensive support for emotes accessible by the bot.

### Warning
Scripture says:

```
"Great is our Lord, vast in power, with wisdom beyond measure." (Psalms 147:5 New American Bible, Revised Edition)
```

Though mankind, over the course of thousands of years, has accrued a comprehensive knowledge base -- one that we have leveraged by taking ourselves to the distant frontiers of this world and, soon, the next -- individually we remain ever fallible.

This codebase serves as a testimony to this fact.

The code behind this project was written in a process of delirium. There are seldom comments and, more often than not, implementation choices remain questionable upon closer examination. In its current state, the only being that understands the code I have written *is* God. 

Efforts to maintain this codebase will come as needed. And efforts to better document may come once the details necessary are realized in a dream. For the moment, you are on your own in all matters regarding this project.
